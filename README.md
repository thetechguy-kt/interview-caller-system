# <b>Interview Queue Caller System</b>
# <i>A simple, offline interview management system with a queue-based caller system, built using Python and Tkinter.</i>

This is a multi-part application designed to streamline the candidate flow management during interviews or walk-in assessments. It automates token generation, queue control, and live displays for interview counters. Built with Python and Tkinter, the system uses Excel and JSON files for data storage and operates entirely offline.

## üìÑ 1. Candidate Token Generator App - `Candidate POS.py (With Packaged .exe File for Windows)`
This is the front-desk application where a staff member logs each candidate as they arrive. It:
  - Allows entry of candidate name and contact number
  - Automatically assigns and displays a daily token number
  - Saves each entry into an Excel file `candidate_list.xlsx`
  - Generates a printable PDF ticket for the candidate with QR code and interview info
  - Resets the token count every day automatically
  - Stores token data in a daily folder under `Tickets/YYYY-MM-DD - Tickets`
  - Tracks date using `config/last_ticket_date.txt`

> <b> Ideal for reception or registration desk staff to quickly log and print token slips. </b>

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. Interview Room Control Panel - `Interview Room 1.py, Interview Room 2.py (With Packaged .exe File for Windows for both the Python Files)`
This app runs inside each interview room and allows the interviewer or assistant to call the next candidate. Each instance represents one counter/room and includes:
  - A main control window (e.g., for Room 1)
  - A pop-up display window visible to candidates
  - A Call Next button that selects the next available token
  - Recall, Waiting, Open/Close Room controls
  - Updates a central file queue_state.json with the list of called tokens
  - Only reads from `candidate_list.xlsx` (does not write to it)

> <b> Multiple rooms can run their own instance (Room 1, Room 2, and more), and all will coordinate via the shared `queue_state.json`. </b>

## üì∫ 3. Central Display Board - `Central Display.py (With Packaged .exe File for Windows)`
This is the live token display screen visible to waiting candidates. It auto-refreshes every few seconds and shows:
  - The current token number and candidate name
  - The room number where the candidate should go
  - A clean layout suitable for large screens or TV monitors
It pulls data from:
  - `queue_state.json` ‚Üí Called token data (Updated by Room apps)
  - `candidate_list.xlsx` ‚Üí Candidate names and details

> <b>This app is read-only and does not modify any files. Place it in the same folder as the shared `.json` and `.xlsx` files for live updates.</b>

## üóÇÔ∏è 4. Record Viewer App - `Record Viewer.py (With Packaged .exe File for Windows)`
This utility app is designed for admins or HR staff to monitor, review, or audit the list of registered or interviewed candidates. It:
  - Loads and displays the contents of `candidate_list.xlsx` in a tabular view
  - Uses a simple Tkinter-based table/grid or a widget like `ttk.Treeview`
  - Supports scrolling for large datasets
  - Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds to reflect new candidate entries
  - Is fully read-only ‚Äî it does not modify the Excel file

> <b>This app is especially helpful during busy interview sessions for non-technical users who need a live, automatically refreshing view of which candidates have registered and when. It‚Äôs also ideal for verifying past entries, performing audit checks, or exporting data manually ‚Äî all without needing to open Excel separately.</b>

<b> Note: 
  - Place all files in a single folder. Also include `dip_config/notify.wav`, which plays a sound and highlights the name when a new candidate is called from Room 1, 2, etc. You can     change the sound path in the Python File. Compile using PyInstaller or similar to create a `.exe File`. In the `.exe Files` the sound is embedded within the app.
  - `.exe Files` can be accessed from by Clicking Here: [Drive Share Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dhkN6V82qp-A2-ePw5LvCwpez8Fb67YU?usp=sharing)
